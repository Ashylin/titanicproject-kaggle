# Titanic Survival Prediction competition (Beginner Project)

This is my first Kaggle project for titanic competition. I followed the Titanic tutorial to learn how to:
- Clean data
- Use machine learning (Logistic Regression)
- Submit predictions to Kaggle

Iâ€™m still learning, and this helped me understand the basics of data science.
