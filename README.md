# Titanic Survival Prediction (Beginner Project)

This is my first Kaggle project. I followed the Titanic tutorial to learn how to:
- Clean data
- Use machine learning (Logistic Regression)
- Submit predictions to Kaggle

I’m still learning, and this helped me understand the basics of data science.
